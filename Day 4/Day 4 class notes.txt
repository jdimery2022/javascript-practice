Day 4 notes

js has the ability to compute, change, add, remove, things on the DOM(HTML page).. getElementById, getElementsByClassName, querySelector are all ways to grab elements from the DOM.. you can then do endless manipulation once grabbed ..(as he is showing now)


The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:
*from my favorite website mdn web docs

edge cases:
function getValidDigit(iteration){
let number = prompt( ' enter ${iteration}
number');
if (isNaN(number)){
alert('This is not a number. Please enter digits olny');
return getValidDigit(iteration);
}
return number;
}
